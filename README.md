# IOT Application

# Overview
This is an experimental project aimed at exploring and demonstrating the functionality of web scraping using various technologies. The project utilizes the MQTT protocol for lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging and Node.js as the programming language for implementing the core logic. Additionally, it features Knex.js as a flexible SQL query builder to interact with databases.

# Features
MQTT Protocol: Utilizes MQTT for efficient and scalable messaging between components.   
Node.js: Implements the core logic and processing tasks.   
Knex.js: Offers a flexible and powerful SQL query builder for database interactions.   
JSON API: Provides the scraped data in a JSON format through a REST API.   

# Note
This project is experimental and developed for personal learning and exploration. It may not be suitable for production use but serves as a practical example of integrating MQTT, Node.js, and Knex.js for web scraping and data handling.
